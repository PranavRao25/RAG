Adjustment points

Alignment accuracy

Alignment marks

Alignment process

After loading the specimen to the microscope, the absolute position and the angle
between specimen system and stage system are undefined. An Adjustment
procedure makes it possible to find out the coordinate transformation from the
specimen-system to the stage-system, which allows you to navigate on your
specimen by means of specimen coordinate (using for instance the virtual specimen).
For this process some points with well known coordinates in the specimen system
are needed, they are called adjustment points. Of course the accuracy of the
adjustment cannot be better than the accuracy of the used stage. In fact there are a
lot of variations for choosing the points and the specimen adjustment tool is aimed
at attaining as much information as possible of your chosen set of adjustment points
and avoiding overdetermination.

The alignment accuracy indicates the variation between the actual position and the
target position. This procedure is referred to as Alignment process. Approaching the
target by means of correcting the beam deflection (digital shift and rotation)
according to the mismatch between actual and target position can achieve an
accuracy of less than some ten nanometers.

For the execution of an Alignment process one needs to take an image which
exhibits some structure characteristics with well known coordinates. This can be
either specially structured adjusting aids or some distinctive features of the already
patterned structures, both are referred to as Alignment marks (or simply marks) here
in general.

It is a common challenge for a lithography task to place new elements in the correct
positional arrangement with respect to some already existing structures on a sample.
eLitho offers a capable method to execute the positioning procedure which is
referred to as Alignment process. The basic steps of an Alignment process and also a
lot of additional information concerning this matter can be found in the section:
Alignment settings tab. In many cases a single-step Alignment process is sufficient to
achieve the required alignment accuracy. In some cases however when a very high
accuracy is claimed there is the necessity to execute more than one cycle of the
procedure. eLitho allows you to set up these multi-step Alignment processes clearly
and gives you the opportunity to configure the procedure adequately for nearly every
alignment task occurring. Please do not mix up the Alignment process described here
with the sample adjustment, which is used to determine the position and the
orientation of the sample system according to the stage system.

Area dose

Area element

Backlash

Beam Blanker

Cycles

Dose

Description

The area dose is defined as electric charge per area in micro-Coulomb per square-
centimeter: Beside its general meaning as a dose value for exposure (see: Exposure
tab) the area dose is also relevant for the image capture during an Alignment process
(see: Capture area tab) ). Image capture causes some undesirable background dose
within the capture area. Hence it is necessary to incorporate this area dose for the
following exposure process. On the one hand the overall background dose must not
exceed a certain critical value. For resist processes the capture area ought to be not
dissolved by the developer and for beam induced processes the deposition or
removal of material should be minimized. The area dose rises with the resolution for
a fixed Pixel time.

Rectangles, circles, ellipses, arcs, and polygons are normally drawn as (filled) area
elements. They are scanned as laminar elements and therefore they are treated with
the Area settings made in the eLitho Exposure settings tab.

The backlash feature is a common method to compensate the mechanical tolerance
of a mechanical drive gear. The sample stage on a SEM for example implements this
feature by always approaching the end point of the stage movement from the same
direction of motion. This means that for motion in the opposite direction the stage
exceeds the aimed target position by a certain distance (the backlash) and finally
approaches the position by moving back with the intended direction of motion.

In order to avoid unintended exposure during standby times and beam settling times,
which are necessary after large jumps (e.g. delay between elements, see: Exposure
tab) it is recommended that the SEM is equipped with a fast electrostatic Beam
Blanker. This devices create an electric field in the microscope column for dumping
the beam somewhere in the column. The advantage of an electrostatic blanker with
respect to an electromagnetic one is that the beam can be switched on and off very
fast.

The cycles determine an amount of identical iterations to achieve the required dose.
Prevention of redeposition (deposits of etch/mill waste) during milling or layer-by-
layer deposition.

The dose determines the cumulative intensity (depth or deposition height) within a
patterning element.

Dose value

Dwell time

Element

Description

The term dose is of crucial meaning for the lithography-process. It is defined as
charge per dimension unit and describes in principle the ammount of electrons (or
ions) that are hitting the surface of the sample in normalized values. For example
when writing area elements applying an positive resist process, the amount of
lectrons needed for breaking up enough chemical bonds of the resist in the exposed
area to make the resist solvable for the devolopper is given as an area dose in units
of charge per area [µC/cm²]. The dose value in this definition does neither take the
energy of the electrons into account nor does it include their temporal distributiion.
The relevant dose values for an adequate exposure is depending on many
parameters, e.g. the resist or the substrate. But of the the most decisive influence for
resist processes (at least for some substrates) originates from the Proximity effect,
which causes a non-uniform dose-background within the range of some micrometers
around exposed regions. Due to the different dimesionality eLitho differntiates
between pixel dose, line dose and area dose .

The dwell time describes how long the charged particle beam remains at one point
of the scanning area. The scanning mode, the dose and the spacing influence the
dwell time.

An element represents the lowest level in the hierarchy of a layout. An element can
be a single point, a single line, a poly-line, a filled or outlined rectangle, a filled or
outlined circle, a filled or outlined ellipse, a filled or outlined arc or a filled or outlined
polygon. Each element is assigned to exactly one layer.

Exposure

Process during which patterning elements are being transferred to the specimen by
interaction with the charged particle beam.

Exposure parameters

To be able to fulfill various process requirements, the exposure parameters describe
the temporal and regional sequence of the exposure process.

Faraday cup

Exposure parameters are settings for controlling the exposure of an entity and
comprise settings including doses, dwell times, pixel spacings, and microscope
probes. Entity in this context may refer to: graphical elements (lines, rectangles,
raster images, etc.), layers (also the implicit live mode layer), or positions.

A Faraday cup is a special device for precisely measuring the specimen beam current .
The electron beam is dumped into a sink for electrons (cup), which means that as
many electrons as possible from the incident primary electron beam are collected
thereby producing as little as possible secondary electrons. Thus a measurement of
the current from the Faraday cup to the electrical ground reflects the actual beam
current which would expose the specimen under similar conditions. The exact
knowledge of the specimen beam current is necessary to precisely determine the
dwell time for the beam in order to achieve a given dose value.

Focus plane

GIS

Image mode

Layer

Layout

Layout files

Description

This plane matches the unintentional tilt of the sample. It is calculated from several
positions where the focus is adjusted correctly (see: Setup of a focus plane). A least
mean square fit is used to do this. So, whenever eLitho moves the stage and a focus
plane is set up, the focus will be updated according to the focus plane. If you want
to use this tool when navigating the stage by means of the Stage tab in the control
panel, the Focus tracking feauture must be activated.

The Gas Injection System (GIS) is used to support etching processes chemically (by
injecting reactive gases) or to provide material for beam induced deposition (by
injecting precursor gases).

Working with eLitho covers two different operational modes: the image mode and
the sample mode. In image mode some of the menu entries and tools are adapted to
the work with the capturing and administration of images. The main difference with
respect to sample mode is however, that the working area is used for displaying the
images instead of the virtual sample and the structure-assembly.

A layer is an abstract definition of a collection of certain properties which can be
attributed in the Designer to the elements by assigning the elements to the layer
(see: Layer Attributes and Layer Manager ). All the elements of a structuremare that
are assinged to the same layer constitute a writing position. The employment of
layers is often used to distinguish the different process steps of a sample. This can be
on the one hand just a different size of the scanning area and on hte other hand it
can be a totally different patterning process (e.g. etching or deposition of material).
In some cases it may be also useful to assign the certain elements to a writing
position to a seperate layer because they should not be written at all and are used
only to assist the design process or for administrative purposes (e.g. id- numbers or
background images). Designer offers sophisticated possibilities to display the layers in
different coulors, so that it is obvious to recognize to which layers the respective
elements are assigned to.

Geometric arrangement of patterning elements (e.g. in arrays or other functional
units) within scanning areas grouped in process steps and process parameters. This
arrangement can be saved in CAD format. Various foreign formats are supported in
addition to the native *.ely format.

A Layout-files is the computer file in which a layout is saved. There is a broad variety
of different file formats which are used in the field of lithography. Very common files
are GDS, GDSII, CIF and DXF or even bitmaps (BMP, TIFF, ...). Although eDraw eLitho
are able to support all this mentioned formats, nanonic offers a native file format for
layouts which is called eLayout-file. The file extension of the eProcessing-files is *.epr.
This format supports hierarchical multi-layer multi structure layouts. Even more it is
able to handle lithography specific information such as scanning area dose factors
and scanning methods.

Line dose

Line elements are exposed as a chain of single pixels along the direction of a line.
Therefore this "one dimensional" elements are also called "single pixel line". The line
dose specifies the electric charge per length unit in pico-Coulomb per centimeter:.

Mask layer

Milling

Orientation grid

Description

For alignment processes it is necessary to capture images from the region of interest
in order to find characteristic orientation features. Capturing a "normal" image will
expose the complete image area to the electron beam. eLitho offers a versatile way
to avoid unintentional exposure of especially critical regions within the image frame.
This is achieved by allowing to subdivide the image area in regions where the beam
is switched on and regions where the beam is switched off during the image
capture. The different regions are determined by combining a writing position
designed with edraw that contains rectangle elements exclusively with the image
frame (see: Alignment tab). Thus the beam is switched on only inside the rectangles
and will be blaked outside this areas during the image capture process. The writing
positions that are used to screen out certain reagions of the capturing area are called
Mask layer.

Milling stands for the local removal of surface material by means of the focused ion
beam. For instance, you can mill cross sections which allows you to get a 2D view
into the specimen. Milling is done by processing individual milling objects. The milling
object defines the area to be scanned by the focused ion beam. Milling objects are
geometrical patterns such as line, rectangle, and trapezoid. Moverover, several
milling parameters such as milling mode, milling current, width, and height
characterize a milling object.

In the working area as well as in the drawing area it is necessary to position
geometrical objects. In order to support this process eLitho and eDraw are offering
an adjustable backgrond grid. This grid can be used on the one hand just as a means
of orientation or on the other hand when it is switched to "magnetic" it discretizes
the positioning area in steps of the grid pacing. See: eLitho Standard toolbar eDraw
Standard toolbar.

Patterning element

Geometric object that shall be transferred to the specimen by means of particle
beam processes.

Pixel time

Pixel dose

Preview

Every object that is scanned during the lithography process is composed of discrete
single pixels. Thus the signal is integrated for every pixel of an image and the
elements that are patterned are also composed of discrete pixels. In case of
patterning the dwell time (in combination with the spacing of the pixels) determines
the dose that is achieved by the exposure. Speaking of the Pixel-time therefore is not
only sensible for a point element but also for every scanned object.

For Point elements the Dose: is just the electric charge per point in femto-Coulomb

The Preview window displays resulting exposure parameters (mixture of entered and
calculated) for the current selection. the purpose of this window is to give an
overview of current parameter groups and to see if there are any discrepancies.
While setting any exposure parameters, the Preview window can remain open. This
provides immediate feedback for the selected parameters. This function is especially
useful when creating new recipes (one can see immediately, why something is not
working).

Proximity effect

Quick navigation

Sample mode

Sample system

Scanning area

Mainly the secondary electrons are resposnible for the exposure i.e. the cracking of
the polymere chains of the resist in an lithography process. Those secondary
electrons do not only leave the sample surface exactly at the spot where the incident
primary electron beam hits the surface but also a large distance from that spot away.
In general the distribution of the secondary electrons leads to a core region around
every scanned point (some ten nanometers) where the dose is rather high and a very
extensive region where some kind of background dose is deposited. Because of this
rather wide ranging (several microns) background exposure the dose at a certain
point is also determined by the number of pixels that are exposed in a wider
proximity of the very pixel. This effect leads to a nonlocal dependency of the dose
within a pattern and can cause massive influence on the resulting dose distribution.
This so called Proximity effect often makes it difficult to determine the necessary dose
ditribution for complex geometric structures. There are computer programs which
can assist the user with this process by simulating the exposure process and
calculating the necessary dose distribution using iterative algorithms. In some cases
however the Proximity effect effect makes it impossible to expose a geometric
structure.

For large layouts it is not always easy to navigate in the working area or the drawing
area when working at an adequate zoom level. To assist the user in such situations
eLitho and eDraw offer the quick navigation tool in the bottom right corner of the
respective area on the GUI. Clicking at this symbol opens a small overview window in
which you can navigate the displayed area in the working area or the drawing area
by means of the mouse by shifitng the non shaded area in the navigation window.
The size of the non shaded area is automatically adjusted to the actual zoom level.

Working with eLitho covers two different operational modes: the sample mode and
the image mode. In sample mode some of the menu entries and tools are adapted to
the work with the structure-assembly on the virtual sample and the administration of
layouts and lithography parameters. The main difference in comparison to image
mode is however, that the working area is used for displaying the virtual sample
instead of the images.

The sample system is the coordinate system which is used to describe the positions
of writing position in native corrdinates of the ideal system of the virtual sample. The
unit used in the sample system is micrometers (µm).

The scanning area describes a quadratic field. The beam can be deflected inside of
this field during the writing process or the image capture procedure. The scanning
area is defined either in eDraw (individually for each layer) or in eLitho for image
capturing (see: Image Capture). It can be shifted and rotated with respect to the
standard scan-system of the microscope. The scanning area determines the
magnification which is chosen at the microscope. The exact value of the chosen
magnification depends on the microscope and if so of the settings of the alignment
process.

Scanning mode

The scanning mode determines the fill pattern during the exposure process.

Cycles

Dose

Dwell time

Exposure

The following terms are used in SmartFIB. Understanding these terms gives you a
better understanding of the SmartFIB software.

Description

When milling the cycles determine the number of identical iterations to achieve
the required dose. Larger numbers of cycles reduce redeposition.

The dose represents the cumulated charge per area unit of a patterning
element.

The dwell time describes how long the charged particle beam remains at one
point of the scanning area for each scanned pixel in one passage..

Process during which patterning elements are being transferred to the specimen
by interaction with the charged particle beam.

Exposure parameters

To be able to fulfill various process requirements, the exposure parameters
describe the temporal and regional sequence of the exposure process.

Exposure parameters are settings for controlling the exposure of an entity and
comprise settings including doses, dwell times, pixel spacings, microscope
probes, cycles, GIS settings, precision settings.

These parameters combined determine the milling depth or deposition height,
and their quality.

Entity in this context may refer to: graphical elements (lines, rectangles, raster
images, etc.), layers (also the implicit live mode layer), or positions.

The Gas Injection System (GIS) is used to support etching processes chemically
(by injecting reactive gases) or to provide material for beam-induced deposition
(by injecting precursor gases).

Geometric arrangement of patterning elements (e.g. in arrays or other
functional units) within scanning areas grouped in process steps and process

3 About SmartFIB| 3.2 SmartFIB Program Suite

An exposure session contains all the necessary information such as various process
parameters and a layout. Subsequently, the exposure starts and the process can be
monitored and documented.

You can create layouts in the Designer and/or in Live Mode based on a
microscope image.

Layouts can be created hierarchically from multiple layers. During the creation of
the layouts, different stage positions and scanning area sizes can already be taken
into consideration. Process-specific attributes can be assigned to the layout such as
scanning strategy, drift correction and exposure parameters. These attributes can
either be assigned on element level to whole layers or to whole positions.

Attributes and hierarchy levels of a layout can be saved conveniently and thus
enable easy reusability. By creating your own toolbox, this allows you to accelerate
recurring workflows.

Sample Mode allows you to arrange the created layouts on a graphical
representation of a specimen. You can use this arrangement for navigating the real
specimen during the exposure and during process validation.

You can arrange scanning areas on the specimen either based on coordinates in
Sample Mode or by retrieving regions of interest on microscope images acquired
in Live Mode.

The geometrical elements comprise standard shapes, such as circles, rectangles and
polygons, as well as predefined elements created for specific tasks. This includes
elements for cross sections and TEM lamellas. The attributes of these elements are
already customized for specific tasks. This allows you to completely perform tasks
with a small amount of parameters.

The microscope controls are fully integrated into all workflows such as creating
layouts, as well as during the exposure process.

Especially on CrossBeam systems, this allows you to carry out complex processes
combining the imaging capabilities of the microscope and the patterning
functionalities of SmartFIB.

3.3 Operating Modes

Live Mode 

 Limited to one scanning area

 The background image obtained with the charged particle beam serves as

orientation

Mainly used for

 Circuit editing or creating recipes

 Target preparation at a Point Of Interest (POI) / Region Of Interest (ROI) (e.g.

TEM-lamella preparation at a specific point of the specimen)

 Analysis of one specific point of the specimen

Sample Mode 

 Allows you to process multiple scanning areas e.g. of different size and to

position them on the specimen

 The focus is on the layout-oriented approach

Mainly used for

 Recurring/automated workflows

 Combination of different structuring processes: If the specimen has been
modified before, there is also information given (e.g. Lithography)

 CAD layout navigation

 Documentation of processes and specimens (which steps were carried out?

Repeatability)

Simulation of complex processes also possible in offline mode

3.4 Exposure Parameters

3.4.1 Hierarchy of Exposure Parameter Assignment

Exposure parameters are settings for controlling the exposure of an entity and
comprise settings including doses, dwell times, pixel spacings, and microscope
probes. Entity in this context may refer to:

 graphical elements (lines, circles, polygons, etc.),

 layers (also the implicit live mode layer), or

 positions (in Sample Mode).

In order to specify exposure parameters for a given entity, the respective entity
must be selected by the user. Graphical elements (Designer and SmartFIB Live
Mode only) are selected using the mouse. Positions (SmartFIB only) are selected
using the mouse or by selecting the respective entry in the Process List tab. Layers
(Designer and SmartFIB Live Mode) are implicitly selected via the empty selection by
clicking an empty region. Exposure parameters of graphical elements and layers are
specified in the Exposure Parameters tab located in the Attributes tab (Designer
and SmartFIB Live Mode) or the Exposure Parameters tab in the Settings tab
(SmartFIB Sample Mode). Exposure parameter sets are always complete, i.e. it is not
possible for an entity to partially use a set of exposure parameters. It is, however,
possible for an entity to inherit exposure parameters which means that exposure
parameters required for the actual exposure of an entity can be defined either
directly via explicit specification or indirectly via inheritance.

Exposure parameters are resolved by applying the following rules:

1

2

3

If a position specifies exposure parameters then every graphical element in the
position uses these exposure parameters.

If a graphical element specifies exposure parameters and the associated
position does not then the graphical elements exposure parameters are used.

If neither the position nor the graphical element specifies exposure parameters
then the exposure parameters of the graphical elements layer are used.

3 About SmartFIB| 3.4 Exposure Parameters

3.4.2 Conversion Factors of Units

The following equations can be used to calculate parameters for exposure
processes.

Equation

Description

The area dose is defined as electric charge
per area in micro-Coulomb per square-
centimeter. Beside its general meaning as
a dose value for exposure (see: Exposure
tab) the area dose is also relevant for the
image capture during an Alignment
process (see: Capture area tab) ). Image
capture causes some undesirable
background dose within the capture area.
Hence it is necessary to incorporate this
area dose for the following exposure
process. On the one hand the overall
background dose must not exceed a
certain critical value. For resist processes
the capture area ought to be not disolved
by the developer and for beam induced
processes the deposition or removal of
material should be minimized. The area
dose rises with the resolution for a fixed
Pixel time.

Line elements are exposed as a chain of
single pixels along the direction of a line.
Therefore these "one dimensional"
elements are also called "single pixel line".
The line dose specifies the electric charge
per length unit in pico-Coulomb per
centimeter.

For point elements, the dose is just the
electric charge per point in femto-
Coulomb

SmartFIB offers a Process List. This list helps you to keep track of any steps you
made during your work with SmartFIB. This allows you to backtrack your steps
easily and to increase repeatability.

All positions and parameters are saved in the Process List (without drift correction).
In Sample Mode, you can also go back to previously processed positions by and
the Process list is represented graphically. Basically, once you click Expose, a
position is added to the list.

In SmartFIB it is obligatory to state a purpose
for each recipe (FIB Milling, FIB deposition,
SEM Lithography or SEM Deposition). For
assigned recipes this purpose is displayed just
for informing the user. Whereas when you
edit a recipe (in Exclusive Mode) changing the
purpose by means of the drop-down list will
adapt the appearance of the Recipe dialog for
editing recipes for the chosen purpose. This is
achieved by setting certain default values and
offering only a subset of relevant parameters
for editing in the particular sections (details

Allows you to quickly change the used probe
for the recipe. Please be aware that although
the scanning parameters such as spacing and

 Inconsistent

A selection can contain more than one entity of the same type
(elements, layers or positions). If the assigned recipe is not the same
for all entities of the Selection this is indicated by the entry:
inconsistent in the Materials drop-down list.

 None

As the layer is the lowest entity in the assignment hierarchy layers
cannot take exposure parameters from another entity. Therefore
when you do not directly assign a recipe to a layer this is indicated by
the entry: None in the Materials drop-down list.

 From Layer

Whenever you have not directly assigned a recipe to an element
selection the Material drop-down list is indicating this by the entry:
from Layer. This means that the element exposure parameters are
taken from the Layer settings. Assigning a recipe to the layer and
leaving the element Material settings: from Layer is a convenient way
to assign the same recipe to a larger number of elements.

 From Layout

Sample Mode

Whenever you have not directly assigned a recipe to a position
selection the Material drop-down list is indicating this by the entry:
from Layout. This means that the exposure parameters are taken from
the Layout settings, i.e. from the layers or the elements according to
the assignment hierarchy.

 Exclusive

Assigned recipes can be adapted by changing a few special
parameters (see below). For more flexibility or in order to create new
recipes Exposure parameters can also be assigned to entities
independent from saved recipes.

This allows you to edit all the individual parameters directly. To
achieve this you can either choose the entry: Exclusive in the Material
drop-down list or click at the (Create Recipe) Pen button next to the
Material drop-down list.

If there are any previously assigned parameters they will be used as
default when changing to Exclusive Mode. Doing so the Pen button
changes to the Save Changes button. By pressing this button the
user is offered a possibility to save the edited set of exposure
parameters as a new recipe. Apart from user saving the edited recipe
as a new recipe / can even overwrite the existing recipe as well.

The general assumption for the idea of gauging recipes is that a process which is
controlled by a set of exposure parameters delivers matchable results with respect
to milling depth or deposition height for repeated usage when basic conditions for
the process (such as used substrate or beam energy) are kept unchanged.
Furthermore it is assumed that the achieved milling depth or deposition height can
be scaled over a wide range by just scaling the overall-dose. This is surely not true
for all set of exposure parameters and of course there are limits for the simple
assumed scaling behavior.

Nevertheless there are many situations where the implementation of this simple
paradigm provides practical results for the used processes. Eventually this amounts
to the concept of scaling the milling depth or deposition height directly by
inserting the desired depth or height in units of length. This can be achieved by
measuring the resulting depth or height once for the process and insert the value
as reference value for the recipe. When this is done the recipe can be reused for
different depth or height by just entering the desired value in the Depth/Height user
input field of the common section of the recipe tab.

The user does not need to care about dose scaling or such things when he reuses
the recipe. In fact he normally does not even look into the Details section of the
Recipe tab at all. He rather chooses the recipe, states the desired depth or height
and starts the exposure. It is recommended therefore to create and use gauged
recipes for everyday work whenever it is possible as this reduces the complexity of
parameter assignment enormously. This is also the reason why the parameter
assignment for ASP elements works with gauged recipes only.

4.5.3.1.1.1 Exposure Preview

Exposure parameters may be defined in complex procedures for graphical
elements, for layers and for positions. Taking full advantage of these possibilities
makes it increasingly difficult to judge the validity of an elements exposure
parameters with respect to a given microscope. 

72

Software Manual SmartFIB|en1.2|346000-8083-000

4564 User Interface| 4.5 Control Panel

The Preview dialog can be used to alleviate the situation. They show the exposure
parameters resulting from the currently edited exclusive exposure parameters and
also display values that may be accompanied or replaced by informational texts in
case of errors. Previews can be applied to multi-selections as well. If a parameters
value is consistent across the selected entities, a single value will be shown, if it is
ambiguous, a range of values with lower and upper bounds is computed and
displayed.

The Preview dialog is not modal and is updated when the exposure parameters are
manipulated. It is therefore possible for the user to gradually approach dwell time
limits, etc. As unchanged probes are not resolved by the system, previews are
unsupported if at least one selected set of selected exposure parameters uses the
unchanged probe. In this case, the Preview button is insensitive.

Indicates the overall dose for Point elements (unit: nC) which was

the common section.

Indicates the duration of the dwell for each individual raster point

This sub-field is only displayed for SEM deposition.

For SEM Lithography the value is set implicitly to 1 and the
computed parameter is therefore always the Dwell time. For
points the number of Cycles being not 1 only makes sense in
case of very high dose values so that the maximum Dwell time
for one Cycle is exceeded or when you want to expose the point
in intervals with inserted cycle delay, see Precision [}86].

Allows to define the step width for the individually scanned pixels
along the line. The unit for the Pixel spacing of Lines is always
stated directly in nm (as the Lines section is only shown for
electron beam processes where no beam diameter is available for
the probe).

Note that for a given Dose changes in the Pixel Spacing
automatically will adapt the Dwell time or the number of Cycles
depending on the actual computed parameter.

When you have chosen SEM deposition for the Purpose of the
recipe than you can set the duration of dwell for the individually
scanned pixels along the line in units of µs by means of this input
field. When you change the value the number of Cycles will be
automatically set as the computed parameter. If on the other
hand the Purpose of the recipe is chosen to be SEM lithography
the Dwell time field informs you about the calculated duration of
dwell for the individually scanned pixels as a result of the other

Info: Deriving Values From
Area Settings for FIB Purposes

Recipes for applying the FIB (purpose: FIB Milling or FIB deposition) do not involve
separate fields for Points, Lines and Areas but rather offer the Area field only for all
situations. This is because in such cases a mechanism to derive the Line and Point
values is implicitely utilized. The basic idea is to take into account the nonzero
diameter of the FIB probe which results in an exposed Area (2-dimensional) also
for Lines (in principle 1-dim) and Points (in principle 0-dim). The following
equations are applied:

 DosePoint = (DoseArea * beam diameter2 * pi)/4

 DoseLine = DoseArea * beam diameter

 Pixel SpacingLine = Pixel SpacingArea

The values for Cycles and Dwell times for Lines and Points are synchronized to the
corresponding Area parameters.

Info: Computed Parameter The values for the individual fields of Point, Line or Area are also not completely

independent. In order allow for full flexibility and to avoid overdetermination there
is the concept of the computed parameter.

This concept allows for keeping the set of parameters consistent by making either
the number of Cycles or the Dwell time dependent on the other parameters. This
dependent parameter is indicated by the label (computed) behind the user input
field. Whenever you change one of the other parameters the computed parameter
is calculated automatically to keep the complete set of exposure parameters
consistent. If you change the value of the momentarily computed parameter the
role of the computed parameter is shifted to the other possibility (fom Cycles to
Dwell time or vice versa) and the just changed value will be kept constant from
now on when changing other parameters than Cycles or Dwell time.

For the purpose beeing SEM Lithography the computed parameter is always the
Dwell time and the number of cycles is set to 1 implicitly.

Info: Changing the Dose
Value for Gauged Recipes

When applying gauged recipes the scaling factor for the dose is based on the Area
Dose value which was used during gauging the recipe. Therefore whenever you
change the Area dose value for an already gauged recipe the following dialog
pops up:

Info: Gauging for Different
Element Types

Clicking the Yes button removes the gauging from the current set of exposure
parameters and quits the dialog.

Clicking the No button will restore the Area Dose value which was used during
gauging the recipe and quits the dialog.

The dose for gauged recipes is scaled uniformly for Point, Line and Area elements.
When you are working with area elements exclusively the gauging process is
straightforward. It just relates the Area dose to the Ref-Depth/Height and scales
the dose according to the stated Depth/Height and Probe. For Recipes applying the
FIB (purpose: FIB Milling or FIB deposition) the dose for Points and Lines is then
also scaled as the values are derived from the Area parameters. However this
deriving will not work well enough under all circumstances. Therefore if you notice
a big discrepancy between the Depth/Height for Points, Lines and Areas when
using the same gauged recipe you should gauge the recipe for each element type
seperately and save them (with a hint to the element type in the recipe name).
Thus you can apply the recipes independently for the different element types. The
situation is slightly mor complex for electron beam purposes as one has to state
the dose values for the three element types individually as there is no deriving of
dose values for Points and Lines. Here too the easiest way to deal with this
situation is to create separate gauged recipes for each element type. If you like
you can combine the recipes to one later on.

Cycle Mode: drop-
down menu

Allows to specify how the number of Cycles is used to affect the sequence of the
scanning tracks on a global view (light grey arrows in the illustration on the right hand
side of the drop-down menu).

 Loop: The element is filled by scanning each track only once in the first pass. The
scan is continued in identical repetitions of the first pass. The total number of
repeats is determined by the number of Cycles stated in the Details section. This
scan mode is normally used for milling processes when a uniform depth of the
milled area has to be achieved.

 Back-and-forth: The element is filled by scanning each track only once in the first

pass. The second pass is scanned by retracing the first pass with reversed
orientation regarding track sequence and direction of the individual tracks. The
scan is continued by identical repetitions of the first pass for odd pass numbers
and identical repetitions of the second pass for even pass numbers alternatingly.
The total number of passes is determined by the number of Cycles stated in the
Details section. This scan mode is normally used for deposition processes.

 Cross-section:Before moving on to the next track each individual track is scanned
again and again until the the total number of repetions is reached. For the Mode
Fast beeing bidirectional every second repetion of the track will be scanned with
reversed orientation. The total number of repetions for each track is determined
by the number of Cycles stated in the Details section. Thus the subsequent tracks
are finished completely one after the other before the next track is touched at all.
This scan mode is used normally to reach high milling rates whenever a
pronounced redeposition of material can be tolerated.

 Serial-section:Same scan style as when choosing cross-section but additionally
allows to choose a number of Tracks after which a SEM-image can be grabbed

Mode Fast and Cycle Mode are illustrated. Overall there are the following
possibilities:

Loop

Back-and-forth

Cross Section/
Serial Section

Uni-drictional

Bi-directional

Track Spacing

For FIB recipes on the right side of the expandable section Scanning the filling
pattern is sketched. It takes into account the relative dimensions of probe diameter
(diameter of the circles), Pixel spacing (horizontal distance of the circles) and Track
spacing (vetical distance of the circles). The following example illustrates the
situation for 100% Pixel spacing and 50%

Track spacing:

Info: Element Specific
Geometry of the Scanning
Tracks

The exact geometry of the scanning tracks and therefore the resulting filling
pattern depends on both the settings of the expandable section Scanning of the
Recipe tab and the element specific scanning settings of the Element Type tab.

It rather keeps the GIS settings which
were choosen elsewhere unchanged.

If activated, the user has to confirm or reject
every scheduled movement of the GIS
microstage. For this reason a dialog is opened
before the GIS microstage is moved, see
description below.

If activated, the GIS will be atomatically
retracted to the parking position once the
exposure is finished.

4.5.3.1.6 Precision

Allows to insert time delays in the sequence of the exposure process in order to
avoid artefacts of your pattern caused by settling delays.

Control Element

Description

Delay: drop-down menu

Cycle delay: drop-down
menu

Allows you to control the time delay between
successive elements of a position. The Delay
can help to minimize blurry deges and
distortions of the elements to be exposed. The
actual delay is calculated automatically
according to the distance between the last
scanned pixel of the previous element and the
first scanned pixel of the next element.

 None: No delay between successive

elements at all.

 Short: Only a small delay between

successive element.

 Medium: Is the default setting for the

delay between successive elements and
should be sufficient for most applications.

 Long: A long delay between successive

elements.

 Maximum: A very long delay between

successive elements.

Allows you to set a delay time between the
individual cycles of an element to be exposed.
This is especially useful for elements that are
scanned in Cycle Mode: loop or when working
with gas assisted processes.

Info: Expanded Exposure Time
due to Delays

Setting Delay other than none as well as setting a nonzero Cycle delay can lead to
much longer overall exposure times.

5.1 General Assumptions

There are some prerequisites that have to be fulfilled when working with SmartFIB.

TIP

To make it easier to fulfill the prerequisites in SmartSEM, refer to the Software
Manual SmartSEM XB for details.

 FIB and SEM have to be ready for use

 FIB gun is on (no error messages)

 All FIB probe currents to be used have to be defined and aligned (refer to the

Software Manual SmartSEM XB, "Defining user-specific FIB probe currents")

 GIS needs to be ready for use (Refer to the GIS Instruction Manual for

instructions on outgassing, initializing etc.)

 It is recommended to move the specimen to the coincidence point. When

working with the GIS, this is mandatory.

 It is recommended to adjust the eucentricity, especially for automated

processes.

5.2.1 Performing a Basic Exposure/Milling process

The following section describes a basic exposure/milling process using Live Mode
only.

The procedure contains the following steps:

 Acquiring an Image [}148]

 Creating Shapes/Elements to be Exposed/Milled [}149]

 Setting the Exposure/Milling Parameters [}150]

 Starting the Exposure/Milling Process [}152]

5.2.1.1 Acquiring an Image

First step of a basic exposure/milling workflow is to acquire a FIB image. This image
serves as an orientation for placing geometric elements to be exposed/milled at the
right position.

You can acquire a FIB image only in Live Mode.

Procedure 1

In SmartSEM, select a proper detector (SESI or InLens).

2

Roughly approach the desired position.

3 Go to the SmartFIB user interface.

4 On the Standard Toolbar, click the Live Mode icon.

If the image quality is sufficient to position geometric elements with adequate
accuracy, click Capture.

5.2.1.2 Creating Shapes/Elements to be Exposed/Milled

Once you have acquired a FIB/SEM image in SmartFIB, you can start to create
elements / shapes by using the drawing tools on the Tools Toolbar.

Prerequisite  You have acquired a FIB/SEM image

Procedure 1 On the Tools Toolbar, select a drawing tool.

The cursor changes to match the selected shape.

2 Move to the desired position.

Click and hold down the left mouse button while moving the mouse.

A preview of the selected shape appears.

3

Release the mouse button.

This will create the desired shape (some elements, such as trapezoids, require
additional steps). The Attributes tab opens in the Control Panel. This tab
shows element-specific parameters.

You can change these settings to adjust the properties of the geometric
element.

4 Once you have finished drawing, switch back to the Select tool by clicking the

 icon.

This allows you to move, erase change, rotate elements

Software Manual SmartFIB|en1.2|346000-8083-000

TIP

You can resize and rotate already drawn shapes/elements.

 To toggle between resizing and rotating, click once into the element/shape. 

The marks around the element/shape change accordingly from 

 for

resizing to 

 for rotating and vice versa.

 Move the cursor above one of the resize/rotate marks. The cursor will

change accordingly. Then, click and drag with the mouse.

5.2.1.3 Setting the Exposure/Milling Parameters

Now that you have drawn geometric elements on the background image, you have
to assign scanning and exposure parameters to the created elements.

In Live Mode, you can choose between setting parameters for the whole layer and
exclusive parameters for single geometric elements and for multi-selections. If an
element defines parameters other than none, then the layer parameters are
overwritten. To be able to understand how these settings interact, refer to section
Hierarchy of Exposure Parameter Assignment [}31].

Prerequisite  You have created a background image

 You have drawn some geometric elements

Procedure 1

Select an element, a group of elements or a layer.

2 On the Control Panel, select the Attributes tab > Recipe.

3

Choose a recipe from the Material drop-down list.

For more information refer to Recipe [}66].

You can select a different probe from the Probe drop-down list.

You can set depth by the input field.

Click Preview.

The Exposure Preview window opens. The preview shows if there are any
problems with the chosen settings. This makes it easier to find suitable
exposure settings and to learn how the various parameters interact. Once
there are no entries with red text left, you can be sure that the settings will
result in a working exposure.

5.2.1.5 Starting the Exposure/Milling Process

You have almost reached your goal: you have created a background, drawn
geometric elements and assigned exposure parameters.

Everything that remains to be done is to start the exposure.

Prerequisite  You have created a background image

 You have drawn some geometric elements

 You have set the exposure parameters

Procedure

1 On the Standard Toolbar, click the Expose icon.

On the Control Panel, the Exposure dialog opens.

2

Change the desired settings. For a detailed description of each parameter, refer
to the section Exposure [}140].

3

Select an entry from the On End Mill: drop-down list.

This enables you to be able to see the result of the exposure process as soon
as it is finished, or to trigger an operation of the microscope.

4

To start the exposure, click Start.

The process starts and various readouts show the current status of the
exposure process.

To make sure that you can observe the exposure/milling process with the SEM,
the default selection on theOn Start Mill drop-down list is SEM.

As soon as the exposure process has finished, SmartFIB will switch to the
defined On End Mill: setting.

The default setting is SEM. The SEM image is scanning in SmartSEM when the
exposure/milling process is finished in SmartFIB.

This concludes the most basic workflow for working with SmartFIB. You can
now proceed to more complex tasks.

TIP

If you experience any issues with blurry edges of exposed elements, you can try
to select a different scanning setting in the Scanning section of the Recipe tab.

152

Software Manual SmartFIB|en1.2|346000-8083-000

5 Working with the Software| 5.2 General Operation

Depending on the selected geometric elements and also their orientation, you have
to consider an appropriate scanning strategy.

The parameters Delay and Cycle Delay can also be helpful.

TIP

The nudge control function allows you to shift and rotate elements during the
exposure/milling process. You don't have to stop the whole process to do minor
corrections. This can be especially useful while preparing a TEM lamella.

 To use nudge control, activate the Nudge checkbox in the Exposure dialog

before you start the exposure.

5.2.2 Performing a Multi-Site Exposure/Milling Workflow

Requires the licence AUTOPREP.

Compared to Performing a Basic Exposure/Milling process [}148],which only uses
Live Mode, the following example shows a very simple multi-site exposure/milling
workflow using both Live Mode and Sample Mode.

You can expand this principle to more challenging tasks.

5.4.1 Performing a Sample Adjustment

After loading a specimen into the specimen chamber, the absolute position and the
angle between sample coordinate system and stage system are defined.

The adjustment procedure makes it possible for the program to calculate the
coordinate transformation from the stage system to the sample system.

The Sample Adjustment dialog provides a comfortable way to acquire the real
adjustment. After this procedure, you can work with sample coordinates and you
will not have to mind any translation problems, for example when moving the
stage.

If you do not apply any sample adjustment, the first writing position will be
connected with the current stage position, the angle will be implicitly set to 0.00.

Procedure 1

Focus a point (A) at the bottom edge of the specimen.

2 On the Menu Bar, select Sample > Adjustment... .

3

5

Click 

(south) and insert the correct Y value (e.g. 0.00) in the Y: input field.

Click Add.

The point is added to the Positions list. All entries in this list are used for the
calculation.

Proceed the same way with another point (B) at the bottom edge of the
specimen.

Now the system is able to calculate the stage angle correction. The result is
displayed in the list at the bottom of the Sample Adjustment dialog.

For multi-site processes with different stage rotation or stage tilt the

adjustment is always in an indifferent state indicated by 

 indifferent.

This was just a simple example to show how the Sample Adjustment dialog is
working. There are a lot of variations and the Sample Adjustment dialog is aimed
at attaining as much information as possible of your chosen set of adjustment
points and avoiding overdetermination.

5.4.2 Using the Process List

SmartFIB offers a process list. This list helps you to keep track of any steps you
made during your work with SmartFIB. This allows you to backtrack your steps
easily and to increase repeatability.

TIP

To be able to use the full functionality of the process list, the licence AUTOPREP
is required.

It allows you to transfer shapes/elements to Sample Mode and to return to
previously processed steps and positions.

TIP

You can start the exposure of the created process list without switching to
sample mode.

 Therefore just open the Process List tab, select Transferred and click

Expose.

TIP

You can add different layouts at completely different stage positions to the
Process List. While this list is is executed SmartFIB will move the stage to the
according position.

5.5.4 Obtaining Serial Section Images

Serial section images are a basic functionality for generating 3D datasets.
Afterwards, the data can be compiled to a 3D image using specific software (e.g.
ORS ).

SSI is a scanning mode also, which will not deliver nice depositions.

TIP

The process is based on an alternating sequence. The milling is started in SmartFIB
and repeatedly paused for image acquisition in SmartSEM.

Procedure 1

Prepare an edge from which you want to start using the cross-section Cycle
mode in Live Mode.

2

Prepare a U-shaped area around the element.

This ensures that there is no material around the element. This minimizes
shadowing effects and redeposition.

3 Draw rectangle ( or trapezoid) and place on region of interest.

4

Before milling the object itself, in the Recipe tab, go to the Scanning section
and select serial-section cycle mode.

5

Set the exposure parameters. Pay attention on the scan direction: It has to

scan from bottom to top in the FIB image. 

Switch to the SmartSEM user interface.

To obtain an image, use any suitable detector. You can also use dual channel
or mix detector signals.

To check the image save path, from the Menu bar, select Settings >
Preferences > Tools.

10 Switch back to SmartFIB and click the Expose icon. 

For best results, we recommend to apply a drift correction [}151].

TIP

Note that the DC correction interval does now mean SEM images instead of
seconds.

SmartFIB uses the path given in the Preferences to save the current SSI images. To
provide a better overview, a folder is created containing date and time.

5.6 Working with the Gas Injection System

The gas injection system is mainly maintained via SmartSEM but fully controlled via
SmartFIB. In SmartFIB, you can decide wether you want to use the gas injection
system and if so which gas you want to use.

TIP

To make it easier to perform the necessary steps in SmartSEM, refer to the
Software Manual SmartSEM XB "Working with the Gas Injection System (GIS,
optional)" for details.

5.6.2 Gas-Assisted Etching

Gas assisted etching (GAE) allows you to selectively increase etching rates
comparing to etching with the ion beam or the electron beam alone.

Etching Reagent

Selectively Etches

Xenondifluoride, XeF2

Si, SiO2

Water (reactive products)

Carbon, organic materials

Milling Objects Etching is done by processing a milling object, usually with the specimen stage at

54.

There are different etching types:

 Physical etching: only the ion beam is used to remove material

 Chemical etching: the ion beam and precursor gases are used to remove

material

Fig.38: Comparison between silicon etching (without gas) and gas assisted
etching (with fluorine)

Types of Etching

Physical etching

Ion milling

Chemical etching

Gas assisted
etching (GAE)

Physical etching means that only the ion beam is used to
remove material within a selected area (1). The removed
material is re-deposited (2) at the side walls faster than it can
be pumped away. Therefore, the side walls are uneven and
the ability to mill deep holes is limited.

GAE means that the ion beam hits a selected area (3) on the
specimen surface and interacts with a precursor. The precursor
is split up into a volatile, inactive substance and a volatile
active substance. The inactive substance is pumped away. The
volatile active substance reacts with the substrate and
becomes a volatile compound which removes the substrate.
Using GAE improves the aspect ratio of the milled holes and
enhances the removal rate. Thus, the sidewall angles come
closer to 90 (4).

Selective etching

GAE is also material-selective, because etching reagents etch
different materials (5,6) at different rates.
